# Project Hub

This project is inspired from concept of [project-hub](https://github.com/bradfrost/project-hub).
Kudos to Brad Frost.

A project hub is a tool for keeping track of the progress of a design project.
The hub collaborated by team members, so that everyone involved in the team has access to it.

To get started [ProjectHub](http://ss14-team-32.divshot.io/)


The benefits of using a project hub:

* Serves as a centralized place for the project's key design/development materials
* Easily and visually view project progress
* Provides an archive for project artifacts
* Keep clients and team members up to speed with design progress

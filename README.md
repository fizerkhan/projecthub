# Project Hub

This project is inspired from the concept of [project-hub](https://github.com/bradfrost/project-hub).
Kudos to Brad Frost.

A project hub is a tool for keeping track of the progress of a design projects.
When we work with design projects, we have lot of discussion and documents flow
through mail. We want to refer some discussion and its documents, we have to go
through all list of mails. ProjectHub is place where you can clear time line of
your projects, documents and discussion of the every single aspects happened
in your design projects.

To get started [ProjectHub](http://ss14-team-32.divshot.io/)

The benefits of using a project hub:

* Serves as a centralized place for the project's key design/development materials
* Easily and visually view project progress
* Provides an archive for project artifacts
* Keep clients and team members up to speed with design progress
